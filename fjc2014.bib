	abstract = {Classifications are a basic tool for research, which allow summarizing the diversity of objects in a number of categories that fits the cognitive abilities of the human mind. Their relevance for higher education is emphasized by the differentiation of institutional profiles. Yet, unlike in the US, there is currently no classification of European Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). This paper fills this gap by developing a classification of European HEIs, which focuses on differences in activity profiles and subject scope. To this aim, it uses data from an enriched version of the European Tertiary Education Register on a sample of more than 2000 HEIs in a large number of European countries. The classification comprises six classes that occupy distinct positions in a configuration space defined by two dimensions, i.e. research vs. educational orientation and subject specialization. Ex-post analysis shows that classes are identifiable and can be attributed meaningful labels; the class of research universities comprises most European HEIs competing in international rankings, while a class of generalist HEIs with lower research orientation that cuts across the traditional distinction between universities and Universities of Applied Sciences can be distinguished. Furthermore, three classes of specialist HEIs can be identified. The classification provides a meaningful representation of European higher education that is more fine-grained than the distinction between university and non-university sectors while remaining parsimonious. We, finally show how national categories map to the classification, displaying its potential to compare differences in national institutional settings across Europe.},

	abstract = {Today’s public universities are increasingly becoming like enterprising nonprofits. Partly because of financial reasons, they are turning to the private sector to boost or replace their traditional—predominantly public—sources of funding. University-industry alliances in research and development (R\&D) are the result of deliberate strategies implemented by national and international (e.g., EU) governing bodies, as well as the university leadership itself, to promote a more direct involvement of universities in research-based innovation and economic development. This multiplication of stakeholders is leading to new organizational—more hybrid—models of governance that help the university cope with the increased complexity of networks and linkages with which it is involved. This article addresses some of the drivers and manifestations of universities as hybrid organizations, as well as examples of (public-private partnership) models of knowledge linkages between university and industry, such as the ones currently promoted across Europe. The article concludes by highlighting some of the challenges of the increased hybridization of universities, including challenges for research on university governance.},

	abstract = {This study report on the outcomes and transformational potential of the European Universities initiative presents the progress, achievements, and transformational potential of the European Universities initiative, and gives insights on remaining challenges. It provides recommendations to continue making the European Universities initiative a success in the long run. The report is a comprehensive attempt to assess what the alliances have achieved since their inception in 2019 and how they have transformed European higher education and transnational cooperation models. The report builds on a rich body of information obtained through extensive desk research, stakeholder consultation activities, and the piloting exercise of a monitoring framework of the European Universities initiative, allowing to assess the progress and transformational potential of the European Universities initiative as a whole. Data for the monitoring framework was collected in the second half of 2023, offering a snapshot of the alliances’ achievements at a certain moment in their development, without prejudice of the consideration of their progress achieved since then. The report’s findings are also rooted in an extensive review of position papers of higher education stakeholder organisations, a growing body of academic literature on the European Universities initiative and the assessments of some Member States on the impact of the initiative in their country.},

	abstract = {Narratives of change are increasingly becoming the focus in the context of sustainability transition, and one reason for this is the growing awareness of the impact of language on our environment. Drawing on an analysis of narratives of change of the Swedish strategic innovation program Viable Cities, in our article we illustrate how intermediary organizations seeking to facilitate sustainable futures use narratives to develop their strategies for inclusivity, and we discuss the value of narrative analysis to understand such mediation. In so doing, we draw on a narrative approach from literary studies and show the added value of analysis of textual presentation techniques for sustainability transitions research. As interpretations of discourse, narratives shape social communities and not only tell us about change, but also witness, and are intended to drive, specific changes. Our analysis of the presentation techniques of the narrative of Viable Cities reveals the ways in which the narrative seeks to achieve the goal of inclusion, to help drive change towards the goals of sustainability. This is done through the plurality of the storylines and the narration; while the plurality of perspectives is maintained through the essayistic character of the texts, as well as through stretching the time of the narrative.},

By undertaking interventionist research on UNITA – Universitas Montium, one of the largest European alliances, representing 160.000 students, this paper aims to illustrate how a university alliance is tasked with developing an internal assessment methodology to account for the societal benefits created by the project for the academic and civil communities. The elaboration of the assessment tool to assess the contribution to higher education and societal sustainable communities has brought researchers to discover etic and emic implications, revealing the existence of an accountability layer in which the international alliance directly engages with rural and mountain communities in marginalized areas. This research marks a significant advancement in the field of higher education sustainability, providing both a novel analytical perspective on the benefits of university alliances for the development of local sustainable communities and a methodological tool for their assessment.},

Since data warehouses have been used to achieve the same goal, they could be leveraged also to provide analysis of Big Data. The problem of adapting data warehouse data and schemata to changes in user requirements and data sources has been studied by many researchers worldwide. However, innovative methods must be developed also to support evolution in Big Data systems. In this paper, we analyze architectures designed for Big Data processing and analysis described in the literature with the purpose to identify the most appropriate solution for the evolution problem. We concentrate on four architecture types: data lakes, virtual integration, polystores, and λ-architecture, and, in addition to them, we consider solutions that apply data warehouse/OLAP methods to Big Data processing and analysis. Finally, we describe our proposal of an architecture that allows to perform different kinds of analytical tasks on Big Data retrieved from multiple heterogeneous data sources with different latency and is capable of processing changes in data sources as well as evolving analysis requirements.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for doing systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

After a discussion of the "reality of social phenomena" and a brief survey of topological concepts, the main topic is introduced, "quasi-stationary equilibria in group life and the problem of social change." Various phenomena such as aggression, factory production, ability, bond redemption, and group decisions are considered as the result of interacting force fields. None of the above activities can be explained in terms of itself but only in terms of the operation of various processes which fluctuate as a function of basic forces and tensions. At any given time, however, these forces are at a particular stage of equilibrium so that it is possible to cut into the flux of events. The analytic concept of "phase space" which is "a system of coordinates, each corresponding to different amounts of intensities of one 'property"' is utilized to obviate the problem of a comprehensive description of the total field at any given time. 30 references.

Ss represented the following 5 stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, action, maintenance, and relapse. 10 processes of change were expected to receive differential emphases during particular stages of change. Results indicate that Ss (a) used the fewest processes of change during precontemplation; (b) emphasized consciousness raising during the contemplation stage; (c) emphasized self-reevaluation in both contemplation and action stages; (d) emphasized self-liberation, a helping relationship, and reinforcement management during the action stage; and (e) used counterconditioning and stimulus control the most in both action and maintenance stages. Relapsers responded as a combination of contemplaters and people in action would.

	abstract = {At the time of his death in 1947, Kurt Lewin was seen as one of the foremost psychologists of his day. He is now best known for his three-step model of change. However, this has been criticized for its “simplicity,” and it has even been suggested that Lewin “never developed such a model,” yet this ignores its links to the rest of Lewin’s work. Surprisingly, there appears to have been no rigorous attempt to understand the connection between Lewin’s early work on field theory and his later work on social and organizational change. In addressing this gap in the Lewin literature, this article will not only show that the three-step model of change is far from being simplistic but also that it was a well-thought-out approach to change based on his development of field theory. The main difference between the two is one of nomenclature rather than substance.},

This paper attempts to show how a generalized data system (GDS), represented by two different models, could form such a basis; it then proposes that data policy definitions can restrict the GDS to a specialized model, such as a relational or DBTG-like model. Finally, it proposes that this concept forms a better basis for data structure design of specific system applications.},

	abstract = {While the Internet was conceived as a decentralized network, the most widely used web applications today tend toward centralization. Control increasingly rests with centralized service providers who, as a consequence, have also amassed unprecedented amounts of data about the behaviors and personalities of individuals. Developers, regulators, and consumer advocates have looked to alternative decentralized architectures as the natural response to threats posed by these centralized services. The result has been a great variety of solutions that include personal data stores (PDS), infomediaries, Vendor Relationship Management (VRM) systems, and federated and distributed social networks. And yet, for all these efforts, decentralized personal data architectures have seen little adoption. This position paper attempts to account for these failures, challenging the accepted wisdom in the web community on the feasibility and desirability of these approaches. We start with a historical discussion of the development of various categories of decentralized personal data architectures. Then we survey the main ideas to illustrate the common themes among these efforts. We tease apart the design characteristics of these systems from the social values that they (are intended to) promote. We use this understanding to point out numerous drawbacks of the decentralization paradigm, some inherent and others incidental. We end with recommendations for designers of these systems for working towards goals that are achievable, but perhaps more limited in scope and ambition.},

Big Data Warehouses and Data Lakes are concepts already well established and implemented by several organizations, to serve their decision-making needs. After analyzing the various problems demonstrated by those monolithic architectures, it is possible to conclude about the need for a paradigm shift that will make organizations truly data-oriented. In this new paradigm, data is seen as the main concern of the organization, and the pipelining tools and the Data Lake itself are seen as a secondary concern. Thus, the Data Mesh consists in the implementation of an architecture where data is intentionally distributed among several Mesh nodes, in such a way that there is no chaos or data silos, since there are centralized governance strategies and the guarantee that the core principles are shared throughout the Mesh nodes. This paper presents the motivation for the appearance of the Data Mesh paradigm, its features, and approaches for its implementation.},

But no one is looking at the larger architectural picture of how Big Data needs to fit within the existing systems (data warehousing systems). Taking a look at the larger picture into which Big Data fits gives the data scientist the necessary context for how pieces of the puzzle should fit together. Most references on Big Data look at only one tiny part of a much larger whole. Until data gathered can be put into an existing framework or architecture it can't be used to its full potential. Data Architecture a Primer for the Data Scientist addresses the larger architectural picture of how Big Data fits with the existing information infrastructure, an essential topic for the data scientist. Drawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples and an easy to understand framework. W.H. Inmon, and Daniel Linstedt define the importance of data architecture and how it can be used effectively to harness big data within existing systems. You'll be able to: - Turn textual information into a form that can be analyzed by standard tools. - Make the connection between analytics and Big Data - Understand how Big Data fits within an existing systems environment - Conduct analytics on repetitive and non-repetitive data - Discusses the value in Big Data that is often overlooked, non-repetitive data, and why there is significant business value in using it - Shows how to turn textual information into a form that can be analyzed by standard tools - Explains how Big Data fits within an existing systems environment - Presents new opportunities that are afforded by the advent of Big Data - Demystifies the murky waters of repetitive and non-repetitive data in Big Data},

The challenge is not only to store and manage the vast volume of data (“big data”), but also to analyze and extract meaningful value from it. There are several approaches to collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing big data. The main focus of the paper is on unstructured data analysis. Unstructured data refers to information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or does not fit well into relational tables. Unstructured data is the fastest growing type of data, some example could be imagery, sensors, telemetry, video, documents, log files, and email data files. There are several techniques to address this problem space of unstructured analytics. The techniques share a common characteristics of scale-out, elasticity and high availability. MapReduce, in conjunction with the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and HBase database, as part of the Apache Hadoop project is a modern approach to analyze unstructured data. Hadoop clusters are an effective means of processing massive volumes of data, and can be improved with the right architectural approach.},

With the spread of new concepts such as Edge Computing or the Internet of Things, production, processing and consumption of this data becomes more and more distributed. As a result, applications increasingly require multiple agents that can work together. A multi-agent system (MAS) is a self-organized computer system that comprises multiple intelligent agents interacting to solve problems that are beyond the capacities of individual agents. Modern Big Data Architectures examines modern concepts and architecture for Big Data processing and analytics. This unique, up-to-date volume provides joint analysis of big data and multi-agent systems, with emphasis on distributed, intelligent processing of very large data sets. Each chapter contains practical examples and detailed solutions suitable for a wide variety of applications.

The Ontop-temporal extension is designed to handle timestamped log data, by additionally using (i) mappings supporting validity time specification, and (ii) rules based on metric temporal logic to define temporalised concepts. In this demo we present how Ontop-temporal can be used to facilitate the access to the MIMIC-III critical care unit dataset containing log data on hospital admissions, procedures, and diagnoses. We use the ICD9CM diagnoses ontology and temporal rules formalising the selection of patients for clinical trials taken from the clinicaltrials.gov database.

	abstract = {There are different definitions for ontologies. Different knowledge areas tend to define ontologies in a different way. For computer science, an ontology can be used to describe, in a well defined and structured way, knowledge about a specific domain. These artifacts store rich information that can be reasoned about, this information can also be target of many structured processing functions. There is a diversity of programs that can be implemented to take advantage of these features and produce applications in every area of knowledge. The Ontology Manipulation Language (OML) is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed to describe and execute operations that reason about ontologies. These reasoning operations can be used to manipulate and maintain the current information in the ontology, infer new knowledge or concepts, or even produce any kind of side effect. OML is a simple and descriptive language, yet it is powerful enough to implement complex operations or reasoning engines in a clear and efficient way. To actually run programs written in OML a standalone compiler is available, as well as a mechanism for embedding OML programs in a generic programming language. This allows the quick development of applications that make use of ontologies, by describing ontology related operations in wove OML snippets throughout the code. This mechanism has proven to be a very effective and clear approach for taking advantage of adopting ontologies to represent information, while maintaining the implicit advantages of using a general-goal programming language.},

	abstract = {Datavault or data vault modeling is a database modeling method that is designed to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems. It is also a method of looking at historical data that deals with issues such as auditing, tracing of data, loading speed and resilience to change as well as emphasizing the need to trace where all the data in the database came from. This means that every row in a data vault must be accompanied by record source and load date attributes, enabling an auditor to trace values back to the source. The concept was published in 2000 by Dan Linstedt.
Data vault modeling makes no distinction between good and bad data ("bad" meaning not conforming to business rules). This is summarized in the statement that a data vault stores "a single version of the facts" (also expressed by Dan Linstedt as "all the data, all of the time") as opposed to the practice in other data warehouse methods of storing "a single version of the truth" where data that does not conform to the definitions is removed or "cleansed". A data vault enterprise data warehouse provides both; a single version of facts and a single source of truth.
The modeling method is designed to be resilient to change in the business environment where the data being stored is coming from, by explicitly separating structural information from descriptive attributes. Data vault is designed to enable parallel loading as much as possible, so that very large implementations can scale out without the need for major redesign.
Unlike the star schema (dimensional modelling) and the classical relational model (3NF), data vault and anchor modeling are well-suited for capturing changes that occur when a source system is changed or added, but are considered advanced techniques which require experienced data architects. Both data vaults and anchor models are entity-based models, but anchor models have a more normalized approach.},

Current research for Meta-Data management systems is focused on the management of the heterogeneous database schema but not system performance. This paper describes a new Meta-Data management system architecture, which is focused on the uniform Meta-Data model and the query performance. The new system includes a repository to store an integrated database schema which is constructed from the different source database schema and a proxy database server which is to store used data by following the structure of the integrated database schema. This new architecture can increase the query performance and reduce the loading to manage the huge amount data for a data warehouse.},

In this article, we shed some light on a body of work already investigating the matter. They constitute what we call the “European School” of meta-organization. We show the relevance of this recent European work for the US–UK-oriented trade association research and aim to bridge the gap between these research traditions by proposing a common research agenda on key topics of resources, forms’ differentiation, coopetition, and their role in sustainability governance.},

	abstract = {In their treatise on meta-organization, Ahrne and Brunsson theorize a distinctive organizational form, the association of organizations. Meta-organizations have the properties of formal organizations—boundaries set by determinations of membership, goals, a centre of authority, and ways of monitoring and sanctioning member behaviors. The theory draws a strong distinction between meta-organizations and networks, suggesting that similarity among members is the primary characteristic of meta-organizations, whereas networks signify complementarity and difference. Meta-organizations serve and are governed by their members, though the meta-organization itself may develop its own agency and may regulate its members. It is on this basis that Ahrne and Brunsson develop an account of the dynamics of meta-organizations, placing less emphasis on external sources of change than on the internal relationships between members and the meta-organization itself. This paper appraises the theory of meta-organizations, using a case study of Partners in Paediatrics, a subscription association of health care organizations, as the empirical reference point. Data about this partnership’s membership and its activities are drawn from 12 ‘annual reports’ covering a 17-year period. Focusing, particularly, on the membership composition of the Partnership and its relationship to the changing environment, the case analysis traces the changing character and circumstances of the Partnership, identifying four distinct phases, and raising questions for meta-organization theory and its account of meta-organization dynamics.},

	abstract = {In order to conceptualize international governmental organizations (IGOs) as powerful actors, international relations scholars increasingly resort to approaches that present these organizations as behaving like modern corporations or bureaucracies. Although we agree with the underlying assumption that it is useful to understand IGOs as organizations, we find these approaches only give partial answers. We argue that the key to a more complete understanding of international organizations is to conceptualize them not as standard forms of organizations with individuals as their members but as meta-organizations comprising organized actors as members. Meta-organizations are paradoxical constructions: autonomous actors with autonomous actors as members. An international organization is permanently competing for actorhood with its member states, and this competition has far-reaching implications for the ways they perform as agents of global governance. Meta-organization theory explains why international organizations are less powerful actors than standard organizations are-why it is more difficult for them to make decisions and to achieve coordination and organizational action. Yet international organizations are strong in other respects. Meta-organization theory explains why they are easily established, why they can place strong demands on new members, and why their existing members are slowly transformed by their membership. Overall, many international organizations are influential but in a different way than suggested by standard theories of organizations.},

	abstract = {L'analyse en ligne OLAP permet une navigation interactive dans les données, une visualisation rapide de l'information et une exploration de la structure multidimensionnelle des données. Une des limites est de se restreindre à des aspects exploratoires et navigationnels. De plus, avec l'avènement des données complexes (données multi-format et/ou multi-structure et/ou multi-source et/ou multi-modale et/ou multi-version), l'analyse en ligne doit s'adapter à la nature spécifique de ces données tout en gardant l'esprit de l'OLAP. Les opérateurs OLAP sont définis pour des données classiques et sont souvent inadaptés quand il s'agit de données complexes par exemple composées de textes, images, son ou vidéos. Les limites de l'OLAP ainsi que la spécificité des données complexes nécessitent une évolution ou adaptation de l'OLAP. Il devient nécessaire de : (1) enrichir les possibilités de l'analyse OLAP en la dotant de nouvelles possibilités ; (2) créer une analyse en ligne adaptée aux données complexes ; (3) faire évoluer l'OLAP vers une analyse sémantique des données. Dans cette vaste problématique, nous choisissons de traiter les questions d'agrégation et visualisation des données complexes, de réorganisation du cube pour identifier des régions d'analyse intéressantes, et d'étendre l'OLAP à des possibilités d'explication et de prédiction. Pour toutes ces questions, nous essayons également de tenir compte de la sémantique véhiculée par les données. Pour apporter des premières solutions, nous orientons vers une combinaison des principes de l'OLAP, de la fouille de données et de la recherche d'information. Afin d'introduire une analyse explicative dans l'OLAP, nous faisons une recherche guidée de règles d'association dans le cube. Cela nous conduit à modifier la définition du support et de la confiance d'une règle. Les arbres de régression nous permettent de proposer à l'utilisateur de faire de la prédiction dans le cube et d'avoir ainsi une démarche de type What If Analysis. Pour l'analyse des données complexes, deux méthodes factorielles (AFC et ACM) rendent possible la visualisation des faits dans un cube et la détection de régions intéressantes en réorganisant les dimensions du cube. Nous proposons également une agrégation sémantique des faits et une nouvelle hiérarchie de dimension construite automatiquement grâce aux principes d'une méthode de classification (CAH). Nos propositions sont une première démonstration de la faisabilité de combiner l'OLAP à d'autres techniques comme la fouille de données et la recherche d'information pour faire significativement évoluer l'analyse en ligne et s'adapter aux données complexes. L'OLAP a commencé à s'adapter à leur structure et à leur spécificité (XOLAP - XML OLAP, SOLAP - spatial OLAP). Mais il faut aller au delà et nous pensons qu'un des défis est d'extraire et d'analyser (en ligne) la sémantique contenue dans les données complexes. Ce point constitue un véritable verrou scientifique mais qui est que partiellement abordé par la communauté scientifique. Il faudrait également identifier tous les problèmes posés par les données complexes et ce quels que soient leur nature, contexte ou spécificités. Nous voulons poursuivre nos travaux dans cette voie et faire évoluer l'OLAP vers une nouvelle génération d'analyse en ligne : l'OLAP sémantique. Les problèmes majeurs à traiter seront comment : (1) modéliser toutes les formes de données complexes, leur sémantique et leurs liens ; (2) analyser en ligne les données complexes ; (3) Intégrer les connaissances de l'utilisateur dans le processus de l'analyse ?},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to further develop the epistemological base of interventionist research (IR) as a valid accounting and management research methodology, through the identification of intervention theory and an IR framework derived from social sciences. Moreover, this paper seeks to contribute to empirical knowledge of IR through a critical review of limited empirical evidence relating to intervention theory and the extant IR frameworks derived from action research.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Texts and academic journal papers that judiciously review intervention theory, intervention research frameworks were identified systematically; along with empirical research addressing theoretical and methodological deficiencies of IR and, providing evidence to inform practical considerations when undertaking IR.
            
            
              Findings
              The key findings include rare empirical evidence addressing theoretical shortcomings and application of intervention theory, an IR framework derived from social sciences with extremely limited use in accounting and management research, deficiencies in action research oriented frameworks labelled as alternative forms of IR, an alternate perspective to positivistic validity and reliability issues and other practical considerations to facilitate the conducting of IR.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The novelty of this paper lies in the diminution of the fragmented nature of IR that undermines its scientific value through the identification of an intervention theory and IR framework experiencing extremely limited use in accounting and management research, with the exception of a cross‐disciplinary (management accounting and information systems) doctoral study, optimising IR utilisation with greater degrees of validity and reliability and, finally, a proposed alternative research design for utilisation in IR.},

	abstract = {Data warehouses are a major component of data-driven decision support systems (DSS). They rely on multidimensional models. The latter provide decision makers with a business-oriented view to data, thereby easing data navigation and analysis via On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools. They also determine how the data are stored in the data warehouse for subsequent use, not only by OLAP tools, but also by other decision support tools. Data warehouse design is a complex task, which requires a systematic method. Few such methods have been proposed to date. This paper presents a UML-based data warehouse design method that spans the three design phases (conceptual, logical and physical). Our method comprises a set of metamodels used at each phase, as well as a set of transformations that can be semi-automated. Following our object orientation, we represent all the metamodels using UML, and illustrate the formal specification of the transformations based on OMG's Object Constraint Language (OCL). Throughout the paper, we illustrate the application of our method to a case study.},

Based on an extensive literature review and an empirical study, we develop and evaluate a theoretical model of impact-oriented BI maturity.

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to summarize several change theories and assumptions about the nature of change. The author shows how successful change can be encouraged and facilitated for long-term success. The article compares the characteristics of Lewin's Three-Step Change Theory, Lippitt's Phases of Change Theory, Prochaska and DiClemente's Change Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior to one another. Leading industry experts will need to continually review and provide new information relative to the change process and to our evolving society and culture. here are many change theories and some of the most widely recognized are briefly summarized in this article. The theories serve as a testimony to the fact that change is a real phenomenon. It can be observed and analyzed through various steps or phases. The theories have been conceptualized to answer the question, "How does successful change happen?" Lewin's Three-Step Change Theory Kurt Lewin (1951) introduced the three-step change model. This social scientist views behavior as a dynamic balance of forces working in opposing directions. Driving forces facilitate change because they push employees in the desired direction. Restraining forces hinder change because they push employees in the opposite direction. Therefore, these forces must be analyzed and Lewin's three-step model can help shift the balance in the direction of the planned change},

	abstract = {From a transtheoretical perspective, PROCHASKA, NORCROSS and DICLEMENTE summarise prescriptive and proscriptive guidelines for improving treatments based on five stages of change the client may progress through - precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Change is not viewed as a linear progression through the stages; rather, most clients move through the stages of change in a spiral pattern. While people progress from contemplation to preparation to action to maintenance, most will relapse. Fortunately, most move back to the contemplation stage and into preparation and action. Eleven practice recommendations are advanced against the central need to assess the stage of a client's readiness for change and to tailor interventions accordingly. A small and finite set of change processes or strategies have been identified across hundreds of psychotherapy techniques and across diverse disorders. Eight change process are outlined in detail. In the transtheoretical model, change processes associated with particular therapeutic models are applied optimally at each stage of change accompanied by stage-matched 'relationships of choice'. Guidance is given on how to avoid mismatching stages and processes. Smoking is used as an illustrative problem behaviour.},

Among all the methodologies present in literature, the promising ones are the hybrid methodologies—because they represent the only way to ensure a multidimensional schema to be both consistent with data sources and adherent to user business goals—and those able to support the designer by providing some kind of automation. However, the results obtainable by the methodologies can differ substantially in terms of schema quality and required efforts. In this paper, we provide metrics for evaluating the quality of multidimensional schemata in reference to the effort spent in the design process and the automation degree of the methodology. As a case study, we apply our evaluation to the major emerging hybrid methodologies for data warehouse schema design.},

This neglects the organizational role of data warehousing as a means of centralized information flow control. As a consequence, a large number of quality aspects relevant for data warehousing cannot be expressed with the current DW meta models. This paper makes two contributions towards solving these problems. Firstly, we enrich the meta data about DW architectures by explicit enterprise models. Secondly, many very different mathematical techniques for measuring or optimizing certain aspects of DW quality are being developed. We adapt the Goal-Question-Metric approach from software quality management to a meta data management environment in order to link these special techniques to a generic conceptual framework of DW quality. The approach has been implemented in full on top of the ConceptBase repository system and has undergone some validation by applying it to the support of specific quality-oriented methods, tools, and application projects in data warehousing.},

Pau is an old royal city set between the Pyrenees Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean. With more than 1,900 acres of green space, Pau is one of the greenest cities in Europe. It is also home to a number of museums including the National Museum of the Castle of Pau and the Pau Museum of Fine Arts. As well as the main Pau Campus, there are four other campuses: Anglet, Bayonne, Mont-de-Marsan, and Tarbes. Each campus is fully equipped with a library, sports facilities and a range of student associations. The university is organised into three colleges: the college of sciences and technology for energy and environment, the college of social science and the humanities, and the college of European and international studies. Each college consists of two levels: undergraduate studies and graduate studies, research and innovation. There are 24 research units at the university that carry out research in the following areas: environment and material, geo-resources, aquatic environments and resources, justice and territories, and areas, borders and blending.},

Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

De ce fait, les méthodes linguistiques classiques pour identifier des concepts et des relations sont moins adaptées pour les analyser.

	abstract = {Decision support systems (DSS) are becoming increasingly more critical to the daily operation of organizations. Data warehousing, an integral part of this, provides an infrastructure that enables businesses to extract, cleanse, and store vast amounts of data. The basic purpose of a data warehouse is to empower the knowledge workers with information that allows them to make decisions based on a solid foundation of fact. However, only a fraction of the needed information exists on computers; the vast majority of a firm's intellectual assets exist as knowledge in the minds of its employees. What is needed is a new generation of knowledge-enabled systems that provides the infrastructure needed to capture, cleanse, store, organize, leverage, and disseminate not only data and information but also the knowledge of the firm. The purpose of this paper is to propose, as an extension to the data warehouse model, a knowledge warehouse (KW) architecture that will not only facilitate the capturing and coding of knowledge but also enhance the retrieval and sharing of knowledge across the organization. The knowledge warehouse proposed here suggests a different direction for DSS in the next decade. This new direction is based on an expanded purpose of DSS. That is, the purpose of DSS in knowledge improvement. This expanded purpose of DSS also suggests that the effectiveness of a DSS will, in the future, be measured based on how well it promotes and enhances knowledge, how well it improves the mental model(s) and understanding of the decision maker(s) and thereby how well it improves his/her decision making.},

However, this poses major new challenges for designing effective governance mechanisms. This paper highlights the critical role of digital governance in facilitating digitally enabled exchange relationships. To this end, we propose a typology of analog, augmented, and automated governance modes, each associated with specific control, coordination, incentive, and trust mechanisms. Additionally, we provide a heuristic for determining the optimal governance choice via the interplay of transactivity (i.e., the contributors, connections, and consistency in an exchange network) and corresponding governance costs. Our study advances the governance literature by defining digital governance as a distinct form and outlining key governance mechanisms and choices in the digital era. Finally, we identify avenues for future research in this field. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Data warehouse is accepted as the heart of the latest decision support systems. Due to the eagerness of data warehouse in real life, the need for the design and implementation of data warehouse in different applications is becoming crucial. Information from operational data sources are integrated by data warehousing into a central repository to start the process of analysis and mining of integrated information and primarily used in strategic decision making by means of online analytical processing techniques (OLAP). Despite the applications of data warehousing techniques in number of areas, there is no comprehensive literature review for it.
